## Repository containing sourde code for making a basic perceptron that can learn basic relation 

I wanted to start a neural network first by doing the simplest, a perceptron. I will make a NN in another repo and i will link it here when i start.

(soon: activation functions, log loss function)

this repo uses my_template base so make sure to check the use of this template before using this repo.
